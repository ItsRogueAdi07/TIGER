<h1>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail, and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, namely mainland Asian tigers and island tigers of the Sunda Islands.

    Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates such as deer and wild boar, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, which it defends from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple females with whom he has reproductive claims. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their own.
    
    Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China, and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major reasons for this decline are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur, and the illegal trade of tiger body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict for attacking and preying on livestock in areas, where natural prey is scarce. The species is legally protected in all range countries, which have ratified conservation action plans, established anti-poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger populations.
    
    The tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in captivity since ancient times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment shows. The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide.
    
    Etymology
    The Old English tigras derives from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris, which was a borrowing from Classical Greek τίγρις 'tigris'.[4] In the 1st century, Roman scholar Marcus Terentius Varro argued that the word tigris originates in the Armenian language and means 'arrow', which is also the name of the fast-flowing river Tigris.[5] The Middle Persian tigr also has both meanings; however, today, the connection between 'arrow' and the river's name is doubted, and they are likely to be Latin homonyms.[6]
    
    Taxonomy
    In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris; his scientific description was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi.[2] In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus Panthera, using the scientific name Panthera tigris.[7][8]
    
    Subspecies
    Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, nine recent tiger subspecies have been proposed between the early 19th and early 21st centuries; namely the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian, Caspian, Javan, Bali and Sumatran tigers.[9][10] The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999 as most putative subspecies were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size of specimens in natural history museum collections; since fur characteristics vary widely within populations, it was proposed to recognise only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland Asia and the smaller P. t. sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.[11]
    
    This two-subspecies proposal was reaffirmed in 2015 through a comprehensive analysis of morphological, ecological, and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies, calling for recognition of P. t. tigris comprising the Asian mainland tiger populations and P. t. sondaica comprising the populations of the Sunda Islands. The continental nominate subspecies P. t. tigris constitutes two clades: a northern clade composed of the Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and a southern clade composed of all other mainland populations.[10] In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy in accordance with the two-subspecies proposal of the comprehensive 2015 study, and recognised the tiger populations in continental Asia as P. t. tigris, and those in the Sunda Islands as P. t. sondaica.[12] By contrast, results of a 2018 whole-genome sequencing study of 32 samples support at least six subspecies as the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian and Sumatran tigers were found to be distinct monophyletic clades.[13] These results were corroborated in 2021 and 2023.[14][15]
